* Pandas' DataFrame and Series support

* Support matrix

It should be a table in README telling which OS and MATLAB
combinations were confirmed to work.

| OS        | MATLAB | Bits | Status         |
|-----------+--------+------+----------------|
| GNU/Linux | 2013b  |   64 | working/tested |
| Windows   | 2014a  |   64 | working/tested |

Optionally, it could issue a warning during session initialization,
that the status of the given system is unknown.  It could encourage
the user to report back about a working configuration.

* Donation info

* Better examples

* IPython notebook support
